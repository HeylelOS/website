## What is HeylelOS?

HeylelOS is an open source project aimed at creating a modern unix-like operating system.
It is based on the Linux kernel, and is composed of completely original userspace components.

## Why?

Lots of unix-like operating systems have a long inheritance from legacy behaviours.
While this isn't necessarily a problem, modern operating systems tend to provide a user
experience far away from what we could be providing today.

This project was born from the frustration of not finding a single desktop environment
having a complete and unclustered integration with its base components. If you think from
the perspective of a beginner user: What is a package? Why should I upgrade those so often?
Why do my X11 server config keeps failing again and again? Where is my GPU driver?
Any end-user shouldn't even have to worry about that kind of things.
It should just work out of the box, no strings attached.

## How?

The operating system is based upon a rolling-release model. The user shouldn't have
to install, maintain, update and upgrade his/her packages. The system automatically installs
and replaces itself through time. May it be binaries, libraries kernels and drivers.
The user should only install personal packages on his/her home prefix directories. And if you don't
like the given system, feel free to fork the distribution!

## Why the name "Heylel"?

"Heylel" is a rough transliteration of the original hebrew word translated in the Latin Bible to "Lucifer" (Book of Isaiah 14.12.).
It designated the "morning star, Venus" but could also mean "light-bringing".
It's an echo to the UNIX "mythology" around daemons, but also a reference to Prometheus, the "light-bringing" Titan.
